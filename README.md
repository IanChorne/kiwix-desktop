## Project Description
The idea behind this project was to take an open-source project, find an inefficient user interaction, and fix it as we saw fit. After some research, we decided to work on 
[Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/en/). Kiwix is a non-profit organization aimed at providing access to educational material found online, for those
without internet access. Scrolling through Kiwix request forums showed us that many users were requestuing an undo button for closing a tab. We believed that this would be 
the perfect goal for this project.

## Environment
This project was developed using a virtual Linux Ubuntu environment. If you would like to mimic the development enviornment, please [click here](./Documents/EnvironmentSetUp.pdf).
It took us quite a bit of time to get Kiwix properly set up on our environments, so we prepared a step-by-step guide to help us get everything running correctly. The document assumes
that an Ubuntu Linux environment has already been set-up. If you do not have an Ubuntu environment, I recommend following [this guide](https://youtu.be/t_-hLP1eI4k?si=UYdrz05c6M_aJFrk).
